    <string name="dialog_faq_msg"><b>What is Sense?</b>
    \n
    Sense is a company that gathers context information to improve your communication and coordination activities. We want to create a system that can classify and predict your activities based on sensor information from your phone. Only a system that knows what you are doing can help you to do it.   
    \n\n
    <b>What is the Sense Platform app?</b>
    \n
    This app gathers your sensor data and sends it to our online CommonSense system. Sense is still in full development, so for now the app does nothing for you but gather data. 
    \n\n
    <b>What is CommonSense?</b>
    \n
    CommonSense is Sense\'s intelligent data storage where advanced pattern recognition and sensor fusion can be performed, so the system can learn to recognize what you are doing and how to help you. Like the Sense app, it is still under heavy development so its powers are still limited.
    \n\n
    <b>How do I get to see the gathered data?</b>
    \n
    You can see what information we have gathered on CommonSense\'s web interface: http://common-sense.appspot.com.
    \n\n
    <b>Are you spying on me?</b>
    \n
    No. Sense is not gathering data for its own use, you are gathering data for your own use. Your data is only accessible to you and to anybody you <i>explicitly</i> shared information with.</string>

    <string name="dialog_update_msg">After weeks of waiting, the CommonSense web interface is finally in a presentable state. Although it is still far from finished, you can have a peek at the collected data by logging in at http://common-sense.appspot.com.
    \n\n
    We recommend using a regular computer instead of your Android, because the interface is not really suited for smaller screens.  
    \n\n
    Happy experimenting!</string>
