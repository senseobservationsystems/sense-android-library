# Sensei Demo

This is a demo application for the Sensei project.
It shows how to cache custom sensor data locally and use the sense sync mechanism to upload with a specify interval to common.sense-os.nl (api.sense-os.nl).
This does not require the usage of the SenseService and Senseplatform for sensing.

Functionality:  
* Create user
* Login user
* Join a group (public and private)
* Create a custom sensor
* Share a sensor with a group
* Store data for a sensor
* Periodically sync data in the background 
* Start data sync on phone boot
